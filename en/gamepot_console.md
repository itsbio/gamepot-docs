## Before use

GAME Platform On the Real Time (hereinafter referred to as GAMEPOT) is a cloud service that enables you to easily implement the functions needed to develop and service games without incurring additional development costs. In particular, it is a fully managed service that allows users to concentrate on game development by providing essential functions and various additional functions required for game operation as well as common SDK. You don't have to develop operational tools or SDK servers and operate your infrastructure, so you can streamline resources.

**Unique features of NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM GAMEPOT**

* It provides various functions which is necessary for game operation.<br />
* A separate "dashboard" is provided for convenient management and statistics. Dashboards provide high data security because you don't just divide every customer by account.<br />
* Dashboard access to game operations is more secure because you can manage your own accounts.<br />
* You can easily link with various product of NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM. In addition, the price of the linked product is reasonable.<br />

**Q. Competitor's services increase cost as the game grows. What about GAMEPOT?**

GAMEPOT is not a structure that increases costs in proportion to the growth of the game. Existing domestic and foreign similar services have an inefficient structure, in which the cost increases as the game enters the box, resulting in an unexpected additional cost. However, GAMEPOT has a hybrid plan that includes a flat rate plan that includes a base DAU and a pay-as-you-go plan that goes beyond the base DAU. The default DAU is 50,000 DAU / day, which is never small.

**Q. Please describe your dashboard security.**

If you access a common dashboard through a client account, all stored account information may be leaked if the client account information is leaked. The security of NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM prevents the leakage of external information at the origin level, but for added security, all of GAMEPOT's customers are provided with different access domains and dashboard systems to keep their data safer.
